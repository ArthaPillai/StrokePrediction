# Stroke Prediction for Preventive Intervention
This repository contains the code and documentation for a data mining project focused on stroke prediction using machine learning techniques. The project aims to develop a model that can accurately predict strokes based on demographic and health data, enabling preventive interventions to reduce the impact of strokes on individuals.

# Introduction
Stroke is a leading cause of disability and death worldwide, and early detection is crucial for better outcomes. The objective of this project is to leverage machine learning algorithms to predict stroke occurrences and identify individuals at risk. By utilizing data mining techniques, we aim to provide healthcare professionals with a tool to identify high-risk individuals and implement preventive measures.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of 5110 observations with 12 attributes, including information on demographics, medical history, lifestyle factors, and stroke occurrence. The dataset was carefully prepared and explored, including handling missing values, performing descriptive statistics, and visualizing the data distribution.

# Data Preparation and Exploration
The data preprocessing phase involved removing unnecessary columns, addressing missing values, categorizing features, and standardizing the data. Exploratory data analysis was conducted to gain insights into the dataset, including visualizations of categorical and numerical columns, identifying outliers, and examining correlations among variables.

# Model Training and Evaluation
Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated, including decision tree, random forest, logistic regression, gradient boosting machine (GBM), LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost. Grid search cross-validation was employed to optimize model hyperparameters. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores were calculated to assess model performance. Confusion matrices, ROC curves, and PR curves were also generated to gain further insights into model predictions.

# Conclusion and Recommendations
The results demonstrated that our models achieved high recall for stroke cases despite the imbalanced nature of the dataset. Age was found to be a significant predictor, along with other features such as smoking status and work type. The developed model can serve as a valuable tool in identifying individuals at risk of stroke and implementing preventive interventions.

Further analysis and exploration are recommended to delve deeper into genetic factors, long-term effects of lifestyle modifications, advanced predictive models, socioeconomic and cultural factors, novel biomarkers, imaging techniques, and personalized stroke prevention strategies.
